## How it works

The Market Structure MT5 indicator is designed to analyze the Forex market and identify potential trading opportunities. It is implemented as a custom indicator in MQL5.

### Initialization

In the `OnInit()` function, the indicator creates a scanner button using the `ButtonCreate()` function. If the button creation fails, an error message is printed. The chart properties such as foreground color, grid, and autoscroll are also set using `ChartSetInteger()`.

### Deinitialization

In the `OnDeinit()` function, the scanner button is destroyed using the `ButtonDestroy()` function when the indicator is being removed from the chart.

### Iteration

The `OnCalculate()` function is called for each new tick received. It checks if the scanner button is pressed using `ButtonGetState()`. If the button is pressed, a comprehensive Forex market analysis is performed to identify market trends, price fluctuations, and trading opportunities. The results are printed using the `Print()` function.

After analyzing the market, the scanner button state is reset to false using `ButtonSetState()`.
